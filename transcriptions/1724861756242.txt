So what's new mark? How is your new job going? To be honest, I can't complain. I really love the company that I am working for. My coworkers are all really friendly and helpful. They really help me feel welcome. It's a really energetic and fun atmosphere. My boss is hilarious and he's really flexible. Really? How so? He allows me to come in when I want and make my own hours. I can also leave early if I start early. There is no real dress code either. I can wear jeans and a t shirt if I want. I can even wear shorts in the summer. Wow, it sounds really cool. I can't stand wearing a suit every day. Which do you prefer, working late or finishing early? I prefer finishing early. I really enjoy the morning. I love getting up early and going for a run. There's nothing like watching the sunrise while drinking my morning coffee. Really? I am opposite. I love sleeping in. I am most alert in the evenings. I am a real night owl. Well, you know what they say. The early bird catches the worm. You know, you could be right. Maybe I will try to go to bed a little earlier tonight.
